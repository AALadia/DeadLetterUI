Goal: High‑level project purpose and the specific task/feature/user story.

The goal of the app is to create an application where users can replay dead letter messages from GCP PubSub.
We will be using a flask app to receive the messages and store it in a database. For the client we will need 
a UI with authentication, before we can access the application.

Requirements: Functional + nonfunctional (performance, security, UX).

Tech stack: Framework versions, libraries, patterns you follow.

All Latest Versions
Server : Flask
Database : MongoDb
Client : Next JS
Auth : Firebase

Entry points: How the app starts (frontend pages, backend app.py, scripts).

start client : cd client/deadletter/ then npm run dev
start server : cd server then app.py 

Data models: Schemas, types, example payloads, DB structure.

server schemas : is in objects.py using pydantic
client schemas : is in "client/deadletter/app/schemas/* (auto generated by AppCreator.py)

APIs: Endpoints, expected request/response, auth flows.

client requests is in : "client/deadletter/app/api/serverRequests.ts
server requests is in : "server/ApiRequests.py"

These are all auto generated by AppCreator.py
